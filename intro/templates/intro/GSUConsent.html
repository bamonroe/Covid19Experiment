<p>
<span class='bu'>Purpose</span><br>
You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of the study is
to better understand the risk perception and beliefs of individuals over
population health risks and health outcomes. You are invited to take part in
this research study because you have replied to our recruiting e-mail and were
sent back an invitation with a customized web-link to participate today. A
total of up to 1,000 people will take part in this study.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Procedures</span><br>
Participation in this study should require no more than three hours of your
time today to complete. You may do this all in one sitting or at different
intervals over the 24-hour period communicated in your invitation email.
However you choose, the study must be done within this time frame to be
considered complete for payment.  
</p>

<p>
If you decide to take part, you will participate in 2 questionnaires and 4
incentivized tasks associated with this study. The questionnaires include a
demographic and questions related to health risks and health outcomes. For the
incentivized tasks in todayâ€™s session, you will make a series of choices. One
incentivized task will ask you about your beliefs regarding health risks and
health outcomes. The other incentivized tasks involve choosing between
prospects with varying monetary prizes and chances of winning each prize.
Prizes are either dated today or at some future date. You will be given
instructions that describe in greater detail each task ahead of the decisions
you will make.  
</p>

<p>
This is a web-based study that you have been invited to participate in today
through an invitation that contained a customized web-link. You will need that
web-link, internet access and a connected device with an internet browser to
participate. The customized web-link will be active for 24 hours from the study
session start time documented in your invitation email. Within that 24-hour
period, you can access the study and pick back up where you left off by
clicking on your customized web-link. After that period the link will
deactivate, and you can no longer actively participate in the study. If you
complete the study, you may revisit the link to view a receipt sheet for the
incentivized task decisions selected for payment. That screen contains no
personally identifiable information.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Future Research</span><br>
Researchers will remove information that may identify you and may use your data
for future research. If we do this, we will not ask for any additional consent
for you.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Risks</span><br>
In this study, you will not have any more risks than you would in a normal day
of life.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Benefits</span><br>
Participation in this study may not benefit you personally. Overall, we expect
that this research will benefit society by advancing scientific knowledge in
the areas of risk perception and elicitation of individual's beliefs over
population health risks and health outcomes.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Alternatives</span><br>
The alternative to taking part in this study is to not take part in the study.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Compensation and Payment</span><br>
You will receive a fixed participation payment for completing this study today.
The amount of the fixed payment was communicated to you in the invitation email
along with your customized web-link that you used to access this study today.
In addition to the participation payment for completing the study, there are 4
incentivized tasks. Each incentivized task has a potential to get you
additional earnings either today or in the future. The amount of additional
earnings depends on your responses, chance, and actualized outcomes. To qualify
for any additional earnings, you must complete the study in its entirety.  
</p>

<p>
Payments from this study will be made at the appropriate date and sent to you
via Venmo or PayPal. Upon entry into the study you will choose a primary and an
(optional) secondary method from those options to receive any amounts owed. If
there is trouble with the first method, we will try the backup. This
information is for payment purposes and held separate from your response data.
After completing the study, any payments owed and marked payable as of today
will be verified by authorized research staff and sent within 24 hours. Task
payments marked payable on a future date will be verified by authorized
research staff and sent on that future date. If a task payment is dependent on
the outcome of a future event, and we only know the true outcome after a
specified date in the future, research staff will verify the true outcome and
make payment within 14 days of that date passing. Upon completion of the study
you may revisit the custom web-link sent in your invitation to view a receipt
sheet for the incentivized task decisions selected for payment and the dates
associated with them.  
</p>

<p>
The research team provides PayPal and Venmo as options so that you can be paid
quickly and conveniently. Both are private companies and Georgia State
University has no authority to handle any disputes you may have with them, nor
take any responsibility for your interactions with them.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</span><br>
Participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to be in this study.
If you decide to be in the study and change your mind, you have the right to
stop participating at any time. To qualify for the fixed participation payment
and any additional earnings, you must complete the study in its entirety.  
</p>

<p>
<span class='bu'>Confidentiality</span><br>
We will keep your records private to the extent allowed by law. The PIs and
members of the study team will have access to the information you provide.
Additionally, the GSU Institutional Review Board, the Office for Human Research
Protection (OHRP), and Faculty and Staff of the Center for the Economic
Analysis of Risk may have access to the information you provide.  
</p>

<p>
We will use a code assigned to you rather than your name on study records.  We
will keep a separate list that links your name to this code. We will use this
list to link your responses today to the responses you provided in the previous
session in this study. We will keep this list secure and stored in a separate
location than the response data. Only the PIs and members of this study team
will have access to this list. This list will be destroyed after experiment
sessions are completed and subject payments have been submitted for
reimbursement.  
</p>

<p>
When we present or publish the results of this study, we will not use your name
or other information that may identify you. Your name and other facts that
might point to you will not appear when we present this study or publish its
results. The findings will be summarized and reported in group form. You will
not be identified personally.
